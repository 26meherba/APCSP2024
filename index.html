		<h3>School: 2023 - 2024</h3>

	    <p>My second year of high school has been a fun yet challenging one. School on top of extracurriculars while still trying to balance the hobbies I enjoy has become harder, due to the amount of responsibilities sophomore year has brought with it. However, I do enjoy all of my classes and have learned a lot this far!</p>

		<p>I enjoy a couple of activities outside of school. I love to read and have been an avid reader my whole life. I also love to listen to music, paint, write, and watch basketball. I am also the Vice President of the PHS Debate Team. This is my 7th year doing debate. I am a part of Affinity Mentorship as well, where I do a lot of social justice work in the community and spend time with my South Asian group of mentees ranging from ages 5-9.</p>
